# Heart Disease Prediction 

Heart disease prediction for CMC-16 (Data Science Practices) course. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based in 13 patient's features associated to the clinical assessment moment. The target ("goal" field) consists in an integer valued from 0 (no presence of disease) to 4 (the highest level of disease).

## Data

### Source

### Explanation

1. #3 (age) : age in years
2. #4 (sex) : sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. #9 (cp) : chest pain type -- Value 1: typical angina -- Value 2: atypical angina -- Value 3: non-anginal pain -- Value 4: asymptomatic
4. #10 (trestbps) : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. #12 (chol): serum cholestoral in mg/dl
 6. #16 (fbs) : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. #19 (restecg) : resting electrocardiographic results -- Value 0: normal -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8. #32 (thalach) : maximum heart rate achieved
9. #38 (exang): exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. #40 (oldpeak): ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. #41 (slope) : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment -- Value 1: upsloping -- Value 2: flat -- Value 3: downsloping
12. #44 (ca) : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. #51 (thal): 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
